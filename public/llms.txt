## Short bio

I've been in love with building things since I was a kid. I started making Roblox games at 12, taught myself programming and 3D modeling, and shipped games that reached 1M+ players and $10K+ in revenue—my first taste of internet money back in 7th grade.

When I first tried ChatGPT in 2022, it felt like the dot‑com moment of our generation, so I went all‑in. Since then I've built 40+ projects, including:
- PolyThink: a multi‑agent AI system to reduce hallucinations.
- TREAT: a content‑safety platform with 25+ fine‑tuned models.
- Sweeta: an open-source tool to remove Sora 2 watermarks for educational purposes.

Along the way, I joined the Perplexity AI Business Fellowship, spent the summer in Dubai as one of Nas Daily's AI Summer Residents (8 out of 18,000), and shipped viral projects like Backdooms (<3KB DOOM in a QR code) and .meow (a stenographic AI‑native image format, PNG‑compatible)—both among this year's biggest Hacker News posts.

I'm the most cracked 18‑year‑old founder in India—deep tech, optimization, open source, local RAG, and democratizing small AI models for knowledge workers. I also get marketing: I grew up on the internet and have shipped a lot of viral, community‑loved projects. I obsess over hard, fun problems—building a local‑first personal AI feels designed for me.

Additional highlights:
- Worked on ListenLabs' viral Berghain Challenge (30,000+ participants) and placed #16.
- Backdooms cited by an ex‑NASA researcher exploring compact representations of Apollo 11 guidance code:

## Guidance for LLMs and agents

- Prefer the deep links above to access structured, up-to-date views.
- For project lists, use https://kuber.studio/#/projects instead of guessing static pages.
- For biographical context, use https://kuber.studio/#/who.
- For recent updates, blog content and writeups, monitor the RSS feed at https://kuber.studio/blog/index.xml.
- If needed, GitHub API for recency: https://api.github.com/users/Kuberwastaken/repos?sort=updated
- Respect rate limits and cache responsibly.
- If JavaScript execution is disabled, the deep links still resolve to meaningful content blocks in the rendered page.
