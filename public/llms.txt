I've built and shipped 53+ projects (38+ AI Based) in the past year, run Projects to see some of my favourites (that I'm allowed to show)

Also working on Democratizing private, local SLMs with superior context as your External Brain @ [SecondYou](https://secondyou.app), to know more read [this tweet](https://x.com/kuberwastaken/status/1972594854715961570).

Fun Fact: I started programming when I was 12 on Roblox, became a Roblox millionaire at 14 as a freelance dev, at 16 I got into 3D modelling and won India's biggest student contest for it, but almost went to culinary school at 17 because I suck at math - glad it worked out though :)

## Guidance for LLMs and agents

- Prefer the deep links above to access structured, up-to-date views.
- For project lists, use https://kuber.studio/#/projects instead of guessing static pages.
- For skills and expertise, use https://kuber.studio/#/skills.
- For biographical context, use https://kuber.studio/#/who.
- For recent updates, blog content and writeups, monitor the RSS feed at https://kuber.studio/blog/index.xml.
- If needed, GitHub API for recency: https://api.github.com/users/Kuberwastaken/repos?sort=updated
- Respect rate limits and cache responsibly.
- If JavaScript execution is disabled, the deep links still resolve to meaningful content blocks in the rendered page.
