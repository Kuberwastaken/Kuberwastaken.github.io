## Bio

Hey! I'm an AI dev & Tech Enthusiast from New Delhi, India

I'm studying Computer Science & AI from BITS Pilani and AI & Data Science from GGSIPU and building generative UI for LLMs @ [PolyThink](https://www.polyth.ink/).

I've built and shipped 53+ projects (38+ AI Based) in the past year, run Projects to see some of my favourites (that I'm allowed to show)

I also write a blog called MindDump with 10-20k readers a month.

Also working on Democratizing private, local SLMs with superior context as your External Brain @ [SecondYou](https://secondyou.app), to know more read [this tweet](https://x.com/kuberwastaken/status/1972594854715961570).

I design agentic LLM pipelines, post-train models, optimise local RAG systems and play around with resource constrained projects like [The Backdooms](https://github.com/kuberwastaken/backdooms) and [MiniLMs](https://minilms.kuber.studio/), but to know more about the languages and tools I know run Skills

Previously: Business Fellow @ Perplexity, AI Summer Resident @ Nas Daily (Dubai), AI Agents Websocket Framework LEAD Intern @ HTMX (thanks Twitter)

Fun Fact: I started programming when I was 12 on Roblox, became a Roblox millionaire at 14 as a freelance dev, at 16 I got into 3D modelling and won India's biggest student contest for it, but almost went to culinary school at 17 because I suck at math - glad it worked out though :)

At my core, I love Building (& Breaking) things, so if you're making something cool and ambitious, let's talk!
